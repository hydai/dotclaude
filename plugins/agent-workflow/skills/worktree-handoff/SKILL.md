  Create a git worktree for a task and record handoff context into a plan file
  that is committed to the branch. Discovers existing plan files in the configured
  todos or plans directory, appends a dated Handoff Context section,
  and commits everything before printing the next-session pickup message.
  Use when the user says "open worktree", "worktree handoff", "create a worktree",
  "start a new branch for this", or wants to hand off a task to a fresh session
  with full context preserved.

# Worktree Handoff

Create an isolated workspace for a new or in-progress task, and record the complete
task context into a plan file that gets committed to the branch. The next session reads
the plan file to pick up without re-explanation.

## Flow

### Step 1: Resolve Mode and Paths

Resolve plan-file locations from environment variables. Defaults to **flat mode**;
opt into **state-machine mode** by setting both `BACKLOG` and `DOING`.

```bash
# Resolve mode and paths from environment variables. Override these in your
# shell rc / project setup to opt into state-machine mode:
#   export BACKLOG=todos/backlog     # source dir for not-yet-started plans
#   export DOING=todos/doing         # destination dir for in-progress plans
#   export PLANS_DIR=docs/plans      # flat-mode plans dir (default if BACKLOG/DOING unset)

BACKLOG="${BACKLOG:-}"
DOING="${DOING:-}"
PLANS_DIR="${PLANS_DIR:-docs/plans}"
MODE=$([ -n "$BACKLOG" ] && [ -n "$DOING" ] && echo "state-machine" || echo "flat")
```

**Mode decision:**
- **State-machine mode**: `$BACKLOG` and `$DOING` are both non-empty
- **Flat mode**: otherwise — uses `$PLANS_DIR`

### Step 2: Decide Worktree Name and Branch

Name based on task type and description:

| Task Type | Branch Prefix | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Bug fix | `fix/` | `fix/sleep-calculation` |
| New feature | `feature/` | `feature/health-connect-edit` |
| Refactor | `refactor/` | `refactor/sleep-sessionizer` |
| Research | `research/` | `research/healthkit-sources` |

Worktree directory name = branch name slug (strip prefix, use `-` separators).

### Step 3: Create Worktree

**Always place worktrees under `.worktrees/`:**

```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/<slug> -b <branch-name>
```

**Prohibited:** operating on main, placing worktrees outside `.worktrees/`.

### Step 4: Copy Environment Config Files (gitignored secrets/config)

Worktrees are separate directories — gitignored files don't carry over automatically.
Check `.gitignore` for config/secret patterns, find matching files in the main repo,
copy them to the same relative paths in the worktree. Never copy build artifacts.

```bash
MAIN_REPO="$(git worktree list | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')"
WORKTREE=".worktrees/<slug>"

# Find gitignored config files that exist in the main repo
# Common patterns: .env, *.xcconfig, local.properties, secrets.json
# Copy any that are relevant to this project to the worktree's corresponding paths
```

### Step 5: Discover Candidate Plan Files + Context-Aware Picker

**Collect all plan files:**

```bash
# State-machine mode: collect from backlog + doing
if [ "$MODE" = "state-machine" ]; then
  ALL_FILES=$(find "$BACKLOG" "$DOING" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null)
else
  mkdir -p "$PLANS_DIR"
  ALL_FILES=$(find "$PLANS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null)
fi
```

**Context matching — before prompting the user:**

Extract 3–5 key terms from the current conversation (task name, feature area, keywords
from the user's description). Then score each plan file:

1. Search file **names** (basename) for the key terms
2. Search file **content** (title headings, `Plan-Branch:` lines, first 20 lines) for the key terms

```bash
# ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY — substitute actual key terms extracted from the current
# conversation before running. Do NOT execute this block with these hardcoded terms.
TERMS="<term1>\|<term2>\|<term3>"  # replace with actual key terms
CANDIDATES=""
while IFS= read -r f; do
  [ -z "$f" ] && continue
  score=$(head -20 "$f" | grep -i -c "$TERMS" 2>/dev/null); score=${score:-0}
  name_score=$(basename "$f" | grep -i -c "$TERMS" 2>/dev/null); name_score=${name_score:-0}
  total=$((score + name_score * 2))
  [ "$total" -gt 0 ] && CANDIDATES="$CANDIDATES\n$total $f"
done <<< "$ALL_FILES"
CANDIDATES=$(printf '%b' "$CANDIDATES" | sort -rn)
MATCH_COUNT=$([ -n "$CANDIDATES" ] && printf '%b' "$CANDIDATES" | grep -c . || echo 0)
```

**Match count** = number of files with a score greater than zero (i.e., at least one key term found in the filename or first 20 lines of content).

**Decision based on match count:**

- **0 matches** — if `$ALL_FILES` is non-empty, briefly tell the user: "No matching plans found for this task — creating a new plan file. (Reply with a filename to use an existing plan instead.)" Then proceed to Step 6 to create a new file.
- **1 match** — use it automatically, no prompt. Print: `→ Matched plan: <filename>` so the user knows what was selected.
- **2+ matches** — show only the matching candidates (not all files) with index numbers, then ask:

  > "Found N matching plans. Which one does this worktree belong to? Enter a number to reuse it, or 'new' to create a fresh plan file."

  In state-machine mode, note the source directory in parentheses (Backlog / Doing) next to each filename.

**If no plan files exist at all**, skip all of the above and proceed directly to creating a new file.

**Recording the source:** When a file is selected, set `PLAN_SOURCE=backlog` or
`PLAN_SOURCE=doing` based on which directory it came from. Step 6 checks
`$PLAN_SOURCE` to decide whether to run `git mv` (only when `PLAN_SOURCE=backlog`).

### Step 6: Prepare the Plan File

#### If user picked 'new' (or no plans exist)

Create a new file:
- State-machine mode: `<doing>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<branch-slug>.md`
- Flat mode: `<plans-dir>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<branch-slug>.md`

Where `<branch-slug>` = branch name with `/` replaced by `-`
(e.g., `fix/sleep-calculation` → `fix-sleep-calculation`).
Date from `$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`.

New file content:
```markdown
<!--
Plan-Branch: <branch-name>
-->

## Handoff Context (<YYYY-MM-DD>, branch: <branch-name>)

### Problem Background
<why is this being done — user reports, screenshots, logs>

### Root Cause
<known technical issues, with file paths + line numbers>

### Items to Fix / Implement
- [ ] <item with expected approach>

### Key Files
| path | description |
|------|-------------|

### Current Progress
Not started.
```

Fill in the five sections based on context from the current conversation.

#### If user picked an existing file

1. **Move from backlog to doing (state-machine mode only):**
   If the selected file is in `$BACKLOG`, move it:
   ```bash
   git mv "$BACKLOG/<filename>" "$DOING/<filename>"
   PLAN_FILE="$DOING/<filename>"
   ```
   In flat mode, skip this step — the file stays in place.

2. **Ensure the `Plan-Branch:` marker block exists at the top of the file.**
   If the file already starts with an HTML comment block containing at least one
   `Plan-Branch:` line, check whether `Plan-Branch: <branch-name>` is already
   present. If it is absent, append the line inside the existing comment block:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
import sys
branch, path = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]
with open(path) as f: content = f.read()
idx = content.find('\n-->')
if idx != -1:
    content = content[:idx+1] + 'Plan-Branch: ' + branch + '\n' + content[idx+1:]
with open(path, 'w') as f: f.write(content)
" "<branch-name>" "$PLAN_FILE"
   ```
   If no comment block exists at the top (legacy file), prepend one:
   ```markdown
   <!--
   Plan-Branch: <branch-name>
   -->
   ```

3. **Append the handoff section at the end of the file:**
   ```markdown

   ## Handoff Context (<YYYY-MM-DD>, branch: <branch-name>)

   ### Problem Background
   <why is this being done — user reports, screenshots, logs>

   ### Root Cause
   <known technical issues, with file paths + line numbers>

   ### Items to Fix / Implement
   - [ ] <item with expected approach>

   ### Key Files
   | path | description |
   |------|-------------|

   ### Current Progress
   <not started / steps done so far>
   ```

   Fill in the five sections based on context from the current conversation.
   Be specific: include file names, line numbers, error messages, actual numbers.
   Include root cause analysis already done so the next session doesn't debug from
   scratch. If the conversation had screenshots or user-reported bug details,
   include everything.

### Step 7: Commit and Push

```bash
git add <plan-file-path>
# Also stage the git mv result if the file moved from backlog to doing
git commit -m "docs(handoff): context for <branch-name>"
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Single commit. Push immediately so the doc is visible to the next session and to
PR reviewers. If the branch shouldn't be pushed yet (e.g., experimental work,
no remote configured), skip the `git push` line and tell the user.

### Step 8: Output the Next-Session Pickup Message

Print this so the user can paste it into a new session:

```text
cd /absolute/path/to/repo/.worktrees/<slug>

Plan file: <relative/path/to/plan.md>
Read the plan file for the full context — branch <branch-name> is tracked under
the `Plan-Branch:` marker, and the latest `## Handoff Context` section captures
the current state.
Branch: <branch-name>, <one-line task description>.
```

Use an absolute path in the `cd` command (from `git worktree list`). The plan file
path should be relative to the repo root.

## Example

User says: "Open a worktree to fix the sleep calculation — the issue is duplicate
sources from HealthKit"

```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/fix-sleep-calculation -b fix/sleep-calculation
```

Plan file discovery: user picks existing `2026-04-10-sleep-tracking.md` from
backlog (state-machine mode). File is `git mv`'d to doing, `Plan-Branch:
fix/sleep-calculation` is added to the marker block, and the Handoff Context
section is appended with the HealthKit duplicate-source root cause detail.

Commit: `docs(handoff): context for fix/sleep-calculation`

Output for user:
```text
cd /path/to/project/.worktrees/fix-sleep-calculation

Plan file: docs/plans/doing/2026-04-10-sleep-tracking.md
Read the plan file for the full context — branch fix/sleep-calculation is tracked
under the `Plan-Branch:` marker, and the latest `## Handoff Context` section
captures the current state.
Branch: fix/sleep-calculation, deduplicate HealthKit multi-source sleep samples
so displayed sleep time matches Apple Health's value.
```
